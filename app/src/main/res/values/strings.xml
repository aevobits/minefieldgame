    <string name="rules_description">The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated squares.
        \nSome randomly selected squares, unknown to the player, are designated to contain mines.
        \n\nThe game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking each square. If a square containing a mine is revealed,
        the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent
        squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed.
        \n\nThe player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and may either safely reveal each square or
        mark the square as containing a mine.</string>
