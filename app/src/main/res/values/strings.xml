    <string name="rules_description">The player is initially presented with a grid of undifferentiated squares.
        Some randomly selected squares, unknown to the player, are designated to contain mines.
        The game is played by revealing squares of the grid by clicking each square. If a square containing a mine is revealed,
        the player loses the game. If no mine is revealed, a digit is instead displayed in the square, indicating how many adjacent
        squares contain mines; if no mines are adjacent, the square becomes blank, and all adjacent squares will be recursively revealed.
        The player uses this information to deduce the contents of other squares, and may either safely reveal each square or mark, with a
        flag by a long click, the square as containing a mine. The upper left counter will be decremented, indicating the remaining number of flags is
        possible to position, initially equal to the total number of mines. You win the game when all the squares that don\'t contain mines will
        be discovered.</string>
